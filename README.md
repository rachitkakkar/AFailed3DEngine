# AFailed3DEngine
Does it work? Kinda...
**PS:** I actually made a working 3d engine, so that is why I gave up on this project. The problem was rotation was around the center of the world, and not the center of the object.

# Dependencies
GLM/SDL2

# TODO
- FINISH UPLOAD GLM (IT IS NOT FULL UPLOADED DUE TO ITS MASSIVE SIZE)
